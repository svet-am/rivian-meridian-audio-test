# INTRODUCTION
This Rivian R1T and R1S electrical adventure vehicles feature a state-of-the-art audio system from Meridian Audio called [Rivian Elevation](https://www.meridian-audio.com/partners/rivian/). The full product sheet can be seen [here](https://www.meridian-audio.com/media/8d9e24b1af5e762/rivian-r1t-meridian-at-a-glance.pdf).

While the specifications of this audio system are impressive, Rivian limits the audio input sources to the following:
* FM Radio
* Spotify (in-built application)
* Tune-In Radion (in-built application)
* Bluetooth Streaming Audio

At present (October 2022), the Rivian Elevation system does *NOT* support local audio playback from sources such as MP3, AAC, WAV, or FLAC from a local USB source.

This project catalogs and presents the results of real-world audio testing using the currently available sources to determine if they make full use of the capabilities of the Rivian Elevation audio system.
